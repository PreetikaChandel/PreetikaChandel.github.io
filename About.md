Currently, I am a final year undergraduate student at [National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India](http://www.nith.ac.in/) with major in Computer Science and Engineering who belongs to the chilly hills of Shimla.

Amused by the powers of open source and its community, I have a strong interest in this open and free world. I highly appreciate the advancements going in the CS field and I intent to learn more about the researches in the related topics. Graphic designing and video editing are the other areas that fascinates me. Also, I enjoy music, reading and spending time on quora.

This is my personal blog wherein I would be sharing some of my work and memorable experiences. 

Happy Reading!
