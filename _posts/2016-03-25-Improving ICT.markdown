This march I got the opportunity to attend the third [World Summit on Accreditation](http://nba-wosa.in/contentpages/home.aspx) which took place in Delhi, India. It served as a major platform to bring like minded people across the globe to share their views on the researches done to have a significant learning impact on students. Focusing on present world's education system, one of the major topic of discussion was the [Information Communication Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology) (ICT) enhancement. As a part of this, I had delivered a talk on 'Digital game based learning in Computer Science education'.

Gamification provides the experience of real world inside the virtual environment. Within an effective gaming zone, we work towards a goal, select actions and experience the consequences of those actions along the way. The provision of attractive graphical environments, interesting scenarios and high interactivity brings deep interest and provides motivation. Games incorporate self-reliance in addition to self-determination when it comes to the learnerâ€™s ability to create progress in an incrementally challenging staged natural environment. To support this fact, a survey was conducted.


The survey results and the responses emphasized today's requirement to switch to active learning processes. The effectiveness of digital game based learning was further affirmed by the implementation of a card sorting game which was specifically designed to assist students to completely get acquainted with the various sorting algorithms used in data structures curriculum. 


Big thanks!

In all, I feel thankful to have had the opportunity to share the stage with various renowned personalities from different parts of the world. This summit was a big learning experience for me. I am grateful to all the scholars who appreciated this work and the organizing staff for the excellent management. I would also like to extend my gratitude to one of the prominent academician [prof. Seeram Ramakrishna](http://serve.me.nus.edu.sg/seeram_ramakrishna/aboutsr.html) for sharing words, taking suggestions and giving a special reference to this work.
