                        The emerging field of wireless network consisting of spatially distributed autonomous devices to sense physical or environmental conditions, has gained much attention of the researchers. Being a hot topic of research, I decided to go into its depths and explore new areas related to data dissemination and power consumption. The studies showed that the presence of limited power sources acts as a critical problem here. So, a dynamic filtering scheme has been discussed here to resolve this problem for its efficient use.

The data to be disseminated by a Sensor Node(SN) is first filtered and then sent to the Cluster Head Node(CHN). Sensing a sl...

                        The human face reveals our current focus of attention,  affective state of the person, his temperament and personality; in brief, facial expressions regulate our interactions with the environment and people in our vicinity. Facial expression recognition is a visual pattern recognition problem. The issue of machine recognition of human facial expression includes three subproblem domains: (1) discovering faces in the scene, (2) extracting facial features from the detected face region, (3) analyzing the motional changes in the appearance of facial features, and classifying this information into some facial-expression-interpretative categories...

                        Openstack is a world wide community of giant companies and proficient contributors with a vision of building cloud software. Openstack provides free and open source platform for building and managing public and private clouds. It is a set of projects that facilitates users and enterprises to store and process their data in third party data centers. The community aims to develop the strongest, most robust, and most secure product. To learn more about the path to cloud, one can refer this.

Core of the openstack consists of nine key components: Nova, Swift, Cinder, Neutron, Horizon, Keystone, Glance, Ceilometer, Heat.

                        This march I got the opportunity to attend the third World Summit on Accreditation which took place in Delhi, India. It served as a major platform to bring like minded people across the globe to share their views on the researches done to have a significant learning impact on students. Focusing on present world’s education system, one of the major topic of discussion was the Information Communication Technology (ICT) enhancement. As a part of this, I had delivered a talk on ‘Digital game based learning in Computer Science education’.

                        Natural Language Processing aims at designing and building softwares that can analyze, understand, and generate human languages, so that eventually humans will be able to communicate with the machines using natural languages. NLP works at the intersection of  computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics. Processing or understanding of human languages, especially written texts, requires analysis and implementation at different linguistic levels such as Part-of-Speech tagging at word level;  syntactic parsing at the sentence or structural level; semantic analysis at the level of meaning and finally discourse analy...
